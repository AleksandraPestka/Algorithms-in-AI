# Solver for optimalization problem

## Data
Dataset is derived from the website *https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19*. It consists information about football players such as: name, potential factor, position, release clause etc. Firstly, some preprocessing steps in Python were used to clean the data and select only valuable information. 

## Target 
The aim of this optimalization problem is to maximize 
cumulative players' potential score. 

## Constraints 
- Budget: 100 M
- Positions: [CF, LW, CM, LM, LWB, LB, RM, RWB, RB, GK, RW]
- Total number of positions: 11

## Results
- Total score: 910
- Total budget: 90.4 M
- Seleted players position and name:
